# Credit Risk Modelling

---

Project about Credit Risk Modelling. The goal is to create a model that is able to give a probability of a customer to be default.

Please find a **data dictonnary** that gives you information about the dataset.

You can find below the steps to follow to do this exercice : 

1. Create a project and a virtual environment (using **uv** or anything else),
2. Structure your project (data, src, output, main.py, etc ..),
3. Description data analysis : general description about the data, univariate or multivariate analysis,
4. Split Train and Test set in order to train your model and than to assess the perform of your model,
5. Find which type of model fits well for this kind of problem (Logit, Probit, Random Forest, GBM, Markov Chain, etc ..) and train your model using the given dataset,
6. Assess the performance of your model using the test set
